### Hello !

   This simple project has been made as an entry to MLH's Open Source Hackathon.

   It is a simple game of Rock Paper Scissors that has been made with HTML, CSS and vanilla Javascript.

   This project could be improved in sooo many ways, I can't wait to see if anyone contributes to it and if so, how the project will grow !
